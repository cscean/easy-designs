#summary This script builds a list of URIs (HREFs or citations) from any tags within a specified container and appends the list (as footnotes) to the document, in a specified location.
#labels footnotes,javascript,FootnoteLinks,links

== Current Version ==

1.3 (21 June 2005)

== Requirements ==

This script uses functions contained in [jsUtilities].

== Use ==

In your onload function, call `footnoteLinks()`, setting `containerID` and `targetID` to the `ID`s your desired containers.

{{{
window.onload = function(){
  footnoteLinks( 'content', 'extras' );
}
}}}

In your screen CSS (and anywhere else you want to hide the list and superscripts), create a rule for `.printOnly`:

{{{
.printOnly {
  display: none;
}
}}}

You can classify links as "ignore" to have them ignored up by the script:

{{{
<a href="http://foo.bar.com" class="ignore">link</a>
}}}

You can also use the content generation from CSS2 as a fall-back for the script. When the script runs, it will classify the `HTML` element as “noted.” You simply supply the following rules to add the content generation and then remove it when the script runs:

{{{
a:link:after,
a:visited:after {
  content: " (" attr(href) ") ";
  font-size: 90%;
}
html.noted a:link:after,
html.noted a:visited:after {
  content: "";
}
}}}
