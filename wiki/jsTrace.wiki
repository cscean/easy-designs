#summary Replicates the functionality of ActionScript's Trace window in JavaScript

== Current Version ==

1.3 (1 November 2005)

== Requirements ==

If you would like a draggable window, it requires [http://www.youngpup.net/ Aaron Boodman]'s [http://www.youngpup.net/2001/domdrag DOM Drag Library] (included with the "drag" distribution)

== License ==

jsTrace is distributed under the liberal [http://easy-designs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jsTrace/working/LICENSE MIT License].

== Use ==

In the head of your document, include the JavaScript file(s):

{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jsTrace.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/dom-drag.js"></script>
}}}

Then, simply add the following function to your main JavaScript file (or a library you use) to allow you to trace messages to the window:</p>

{{{
var trace;
if( typeof( jsTrace ) != 'undefined' ){
  trace = function( msg ){
    jsTrace.send( msg );
  };
} else {
  trace = function(){};
}
}}}

Whenever you want to trace something to the window, simply call `trace()`:

{{{
trace( 'This message goes to the window' );
}}}

The best part is, when you are finished debugging, you leave the `trace()` calls in your code and can simply delete the references to the two JavaScript files from the `HEAD` of your document and it will not cause JavaScript errors.

== Demo ==

You can [http://easy-designs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jsTrace/demo/index.html view this script in action] if you have a modern browser. The window is draggable and resizable. You can also clear the window or set a delimeter to mark your place.
