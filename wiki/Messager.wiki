= Messager = 

Messager generates overlay messages onto the page. The length of time the message is displayed depends on the amount of content contained in it, so it stay around long enough to read it comfortably, but doesn not stay around too long. This script will also pick up the content of any element with an `ID` of "notice" and display its contents in a message box.
