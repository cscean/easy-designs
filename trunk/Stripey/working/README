Stripey

Current Version: 0.1 (28 August 2006)

Requirements:    This script requires Prototype.

Purpose:         This script allows you to stripe just about
                 anything you want -- DLs, OLs, ULs, and TABLEs.

Use:             You simply make a new Stripey, supplying it
                 with the <code>ID</code> of the element you
                 want to stripe:

                   var ul = new Stripey( 'my_id' );

                 Stripey will automatically classify the
                 identified element's rows as "odd" or "even."
                 If you'd rather use other names, you can do
                 that too:

                   var ul = new Stripey( 'my_id', 'pretty', 'prettier' );
